ERROR:
ERROR logs report that something went seriously wrong, such as the reason why an app crashed.

WARN:
WARN logs are less severe than an error but still report something that should be fixed to avoid a more serious error.
An example might be if you call a function that's deprecated, meaning that its use is discouraged in favor of a newer alternative.

INFO:
INFO logs provide useful information, such as an operation being successfully completed.

DEBUG:
DEBUG logs contain information that may be useful when investigating an issue.
These logs are not present in release builds such as one you'd publish on the Google Play Store.

VERBOSE:
As the name implies, verbose is the least specific log level.
What's considered a debug log, versus a verbose log, is a bit subjective, but generally,
a verbose log is something that can be removed after a feature is implemented, whereas a debug log may still be useful for debugging.
These logs are also not included in release builds.

fun logging() {
    Log.e(TAG, "ERROR: a serious error like an app crash")
    Log.w(TAG, "WARN: warns about the potential for serious errors")
    Log.i(TAG, "INFO: reporting technical information, such as an operation succeeding")
    Log.d(TAG, "DEBUG: reporting technical information useful for debugging")
    Log.v(TAG, "VERBOSE: more verbose than DEBUG logs")
}
